# Longitudinal-image-analysis-of-biological-effects
This repository contains code to analyse biological effects of radiation and radiotherapy over time. It uses hybrid templates to register images and create a voxel-by-voxel data set to follow in-vivo changes due to radiation damage. A nested regession model is provided in R
